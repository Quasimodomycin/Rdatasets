# What is this?

`Rdatasets` is a collection of 2089 datasets which were originally
distributed alongside the statistical software environment `R` and some
of its add-on packages. The goal is to make these data more broadly
accessible for teaching and statistical software development.

# What is included?

The list of available datasets (csv and docs) is available here:

  - [HTML
    index](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html)
  - [CSV
    index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/master/datasets.csv)

On the github repository you will also find:

  - `Rdatasets.R`: `R` script to download CSV copies and HTML docs for
    all datasets distributed in `Base R` and a list of R packages.

# Adding data

Many `R` packages ship with associated datasets, but the script included
here only downloads data from packages that are installed locally on the
machine where it is run. If you spot interesting data in a package
distributed on CRAN, let me know. I will try to install that package on
my computer and I will re-run the download script to see if the data can
be added to this repository. Requests should be filed on the Github
issue tracker.

# Omitted packages

Here are some packages that contain data but were not include in
Rdatasets for one reason or another:

  - CASdatasets: `install.packages("CASdatasets", repos =
    "http://cas.uqam.ca/pub/R/")`
      - Some of the included datasets exceed the Github size limit.
      - Not on CRAN.
  - Zelig
      - Not on CRAN.
  - gamclass
      - Not on CRAN.
  - Data4Ecologists
      - Not on CRAN. (check out [this
        link](https://github.com/jfieberg/Data4Ecologists)).
      - `devtools::install_github("jfieberg/Data4Ecologists")`

# License

The code in this repository is licensed under GPL-3.

I believe that the R documentation which I copied to the Rdatasets html
folder is licensed under GPL. You will find a copy of the GPL in the
Rdatasets github repository.

I made a good faith effort to determine the license under which the
actual data (i.e.Â rows/columns of numbers) were distributed, but I was
unable to find a definitive answer. My understanding is that these
datasets are free to re-distribute. However, if you own the rights to
data that are included here and you object to their inclusion in
Rdatasets, send me an email at <vincent.arel-bundock@umontreal.ca>. I
will promptly remove the data in question and will make sure that all
traces are erased from the git revision history.

# Github instructions

These are mostly intended as a reminder for Vincent.

First add new package to DESCRIPTION Imports and scrape the data:

``` bash
Rscript scrape.R
cd doc
../documentation.sh
cd ..
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('README.Rmd')"
```

Second, commit to master.

``` bash
git add .
git commit
```

Third, checkout gh-pages and import the new data there.

``` bash
git checkout gh-pages
git checkout master -- csv
git checkout master -- doc
git checkout master -- datasets.csv
git checkout master -- datasets.html
git add .
git commit
```

Finally, move back to master and build the gh-pages website:

``` bash
git checkout master
Rscript -e "pkgdown::deploy_to_branch(clean = FALSE)"
```
